My first little python game.
Your job is to find a random number between two values, X and Y
You can change theses values in the first lines of the code in the python file. The default settings are X=1, Y=100
You can enter a number proposition every time from just running the file, I made a input() for that.

The main challenge for this game is not the game itself but all the debugging I made, it was a first one for me.
Hopefully, you shoudn't be able to create a python error by trying to use wrong values; the program will tell you what is wrong in this case.

Open the python file, change the X and Y if you want and run it one time to setup the program, run it a second time to start playing !
